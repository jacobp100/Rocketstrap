RocketStrap
===========

WYSIWYG Bootstrap editor with a focus on good (valid) HTML output.

Completely abandoned side project I had at some point. Seemed pretty cool, so I thought I'd publish it. Could definitely use improving, and I haven't touched it for about a year. JS needs linting and stuff. Feel free to take the project.

WTFPL or whatever. Do whatever you want with it.
